Defines combined Checker-Spike model anomalies for resolution tests THIS FIRST ROW IS IGNORED (for meaning of the following lines, see below)
40.0   20.0    [km] lat-direction width of checkers on surface and width of gaps between them
40.0   20.0    [km] lon-direction width of checkers on surface and width of gaps between them
8              number of checker layers in depth
3.0  13.0  23.0  40.0  50.0  70.0   85.0  110.0    upper depths of checker layers [km]
5.0   5.0   5.0   5.0  10.0  10.0   20.0   20.0    respective thicknesses of checker layers [km]
0.0  5.0  4.0  0.0  0.0    relative model anomaly (positive percentage) of  density, vp, vs, Qmu, Qkappa

Everything below the expected content is ignored, hence is this comment block.

A CHECKER-SPIKE MODEL LIKE THIS IS ONLY SUPPORTED FOR 1-CHUNK SIMULATIONS!

from the above lines, only the expected content is read (e.g. just two numbers are read from lines 2-3) and everything behind is ignored

lines 2-3 define the lateral distribution of checkers and background gaps in between in lat and long direction 
       of the model chunk. The given sizes [km] at the surface of the Earth are projected into depth and 
       distributed equi-angularly on the model chunk
       in the above example in both, lat and lon direction of the chunk, there will be 40 km checker patters
       with 20 km lateral gaps between the checker anomalies. Set the second values on the lines to 0.0 in order 
       to define a pure checker model
       At the lateral outer boundaries of the chunk, there will be partial checker cells.

line 4 defines the number of depth layers in which there should be checker patterns. Must be a positive integer

line 5 defines the depth values [km] of the upper boundaries of the checker layer.

line 6 defines the thicknesses [km] of the checker layers.
       In the above example, there will be 8 depth layers of checker cells. The uppermost checker cells
       start at a depth of 3km and cover the medium up to a depth of 8km. The second checker layer starts at
       depth 13.0km and also has a thickness of 5km, i.e. goes to depth 18km. Etc.
       Lines 5 and 6 must be chosen consistently, i.e. checker layers MUST NOT overlap and the layers must
       INCREASE in depth. 

finally, line 7 contains the relative model anomaly values [positive percentage] which will be used to define
the checker anomalies, always varying +anomaly -anomaly.
Line 7 must contain 5 percentage values separated by white space, refering to the isotropic parameters
density   vp   vs   Qmu   Qkappa
For example, a line 7 of form
0.0  5.0  4.0  0.0  0.0
will produce a checker model with +-5% vp and +-4% vs and NO anomalies in density, Qmu or Qkappa.
