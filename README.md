# SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI

Author: Florian Schumacher, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, 2016.

The files in this repository (except this file [README.md](README.md) and subdirectory [doc/](doc) were originally 
provided in a directory `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/` that was packed to `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_1.0.tar.gz`
and provided for download on [http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski). It was supposed to be copied into
the installation directory of the ASKI main package. Keept this in mind, when reading
the [README](README) or the [manual](doc/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_1-0_manual.pdf).

Originally, the pdf user manual, as well its LaTeX source, were provided *separately* of this extension package
on [http://www.rub.de/aski](http://www.rub.de/aski) as `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_1.0_manual_feb-2016.tar.gz`. The directory
`SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_1.0_manual_feb-2016/` contained in `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_1.0_manual_feb-2016.tar.gz` 
is here renamed as [doc/](doc) and was added for completeness.
