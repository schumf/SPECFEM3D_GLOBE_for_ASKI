\section*{Guide Through This Manual}
%#############################################################
%
We assume that you have sufficient knowledge of how to run the regular \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} software.

For details on how to get started by installing everything required for using \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} 
with \ASKI, refer to section~\ref{install}{}. 

Before you start using the code to produce output for \ASKI, please consider the general
comments in section~\ref{general_stuff}.

If you are planning to compute a lot of kernels for source-receiver paths (e.g.\ doing full waveform inversion) 
it makes sense to use the automated python script \\ \lcode{run_specfem3dGlobeForASKI_simulations.py} 
which conducts a lot of simulations in an automated fashion. Please read section~\ref{use_script}. 

If you want to conduct one single simulation (or just a few ones) producing output for \ASKI , please 
read section~\ref{no_script}.

Section~\ref{file_Par_file_ASKI} is intended to be used as a reference section only.

Bracketed comments starting with ``{\bf TODO IN THE FUTURE:}'' are intended to mark ideas for future work. 
So please ignore if you are just applying the code.

\section{Installation and Getting Started} \label{install}
%#############################################################
%
This section explains how to install the \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} software 
(\url{http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d_globe})
in order to be used as a forward method for \ASKI. 
In general, a regularly installed \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} version is extended by certain few modifications 
so it can produce output for \ASKI. So, \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE for ASKI} basically has the same requirements 
and dependencies as the \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} code, except that it needs a bit more memory and weigh more 
disc space for output. \emph{Load balancing might not be perfect anymore!!} You should, therefore, have sufficient 
knowledge of how to run the regular \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} software. 

%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Requirements} %\label{}
%-------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
\item You need a functioning installation of the \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} code, including 
   modifications for usage with \ASKI:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item You can either download and install the modified \lcode{SPECFEM3D} version \\
   \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_V7.0.0_extended_for_ASKI.tar.gz}, available via 
   \url{http://www.rub.de/aski}, which already includes modifications for \ASKI (see section~\ref{use_modified_SPECFEM}{}),
 \item or use your running installation of \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} and extend it for usage 
   with \ASKI, as described below in section~\ref{extent_to_ASKI}{}.
   \end{itemize}
   In \emph{both} cases you must install the package \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_1.0.tar.gz}!

 \item You need basic experience in using the regular \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} software!
 \item Also you require an installation of the \ASKI \lcode{1.0} main package available via 
   \url{http://www.rub.de/aski} . The \ASKI installation directory will be referred to 
   below as \lcode{ASKI_1.0/}
\end{enumerate}

%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Download and Extract \lcodetitle{tar} ball} %\label{}
%-------------------------------------
You must download the tar ball
\lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_1.0.tar.gz}
from \url{http://www.rub.de/aski}. Please extract it in such a way, that the directory 
\lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI} is contained in the \ASKI installation directory 
\lcode{ASKI_1.0/}

%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Installation} %\label{}
%-------------------------------------
You need to compile few more \ASKI binaries following these step:
\begin{itemize}
\item In \lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/Makefile} , set \lcode{COMPILER} appropriately, 
   adjust \lcode{FFLAGS} if required and set the variables \lcode{BLAS, LAPACK}, just as you did 
   in \lcode{ASKI_1.0/Makefile} when installing main package \lcode{ASKI_1.0}
\item 
 Issue the command \lcode{make all} from directory \lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/}
\end{itemize}
After that, \\\lcode{ASKI_1.0/bin} should contain the new binaries \lcode{transformSpecfem3dGlobeSyntheticData}, 
\lcode{transformSpecfem3dGlobeMeasuredData}.

%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Using Already Extended Copy of \lcodetitle{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE-7.0.0} Code} \label{use_modified_SPECFEM}
%-------------------------------------
Download \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_V7.0.0_extended_for_ASKI.tar.gz}, available via 
\url{http://www.rub.de/aski}. This is a copy of package \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_V7.0.0.tar.gz} which is
extended by the steps 2.--9.\ as in section~\ref{extent_to_ASKI}{}.

Extract the \lcode{tar} ball somewhere and re-configure and compile the software on your system according 
to the compilers you are using etc., e.g.\ by issuing the following commands from the installation directory:\\
\lcode{> ./configure FC=gfortran MPIFC=mpif90}\\
\lcode{> make xmeshfem3D xspecfem3D}

In order to produce \ASKI output in \lcode{SPECFEM3D} simulations, copy file 
\lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/Par_file_ASKI} to your respective \lcode{DATA/} path
(which is e.g.\ \lcode{SPECFEM3D/EXAMPLES/my_example/DATA/} , or \lcode{SPECFEM3D/DATA/} ). This 
file must be adjusted for any specific simulation (just as all other parameter files), 
refer to the documentation or examples on how to use it.


%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Extend Your Own \lcodetitle{SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE-7.0.0} code to produce output for \ASKI} \label{extent_to_ASKI}
%-------------------------------------
If you have a regular \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} installation which has not significantly
different functionality compared with \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} release version \lcode{7.0.0}
(2015-07-10), you can extend it for \ASKI by the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} on your system and make it run, gain 
   experience in using it (below, the installation path is refered to as 
   \lcode{SPECFEM3D/}).

 \item Append content of file \lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/specfem3D_par_ASKI.f90} to file
   \lcode{SPECFEM3D/src/specfem3D/specfem3D_par.F90}

 \item In \lcode{SPECFEM3D/src/specfem3D/prepare_timerun.F90} in subroutine \lcode{prepare_timerun} :\\
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the \lcode{use ...} statements:\\
   \lcode{use specfem_for_ASKI_par}\\
   add the following line close to the end of the subroutine, before \lcode{synchronize_all()} is called:\\
   \lcode{call prepare_timerun_ASKI()}

 \item In \lcode{SPECFEM3D/src/specfem3D/iterate_time.F90} in subroutine \lcode{iterate_time} :\\
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the \lcode{use ...} statements:\\
   \lcode{use specfem_for_ASKI_par}\\
   add the following line just before the \lcode{enddo} of the main time loop:\\
   \lcode{call write_ASKI_output()}

 \item Append content of file \lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/ASKI_external_model.f90} to file
   \lcode{SPECFEM3D/src/meshfem3D/meshfem3D_par.f90}

 \item In \lcode{SPECFEM3D/src/meshfem3D/setup_model.f90} in subroutine \lcode{setup_model} : \\
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the \lcode{use ...} statements:\\
   \lcode{use ASKI_external_model}\\
   add the following line just before info output is written to \lcode{IMAIN}, after the 3D models are broadcasted:\\
   \lcode{call broadcast_ASKI_external_model(myrank)}

 \item In \lcode{SPECFEM3D/src/meshfem3D/get_model.F90} in subroutine \lcode{get_model} : \\
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the \lcode{use ...} statements:\\
   \lcode{use ASKI_external_model}\\
   add the following lines just before define elastic parameters in the model (i.e.\ setting all 
   arrays \lcode{rhostore}, \lcode{kappavstore}, \lcode{muvstore}, \dots) , just after all other 
   \lcode{get model} routines:\\
   \lcode{call values_ASKI_external_model(iregion_code,xmesh,ymesh,zmesh,r, &}\\
   \lcode{                           vpv,vph,vsv,vsh,rho,Qmu,Qkappa,eta_aniso,dvp, &}\\
   \lcode{                           c11,c12,c13,c14,c15,c16,c22,c23,c24,c25, &}\\
   \lcode{                           c26,c33,c34,c35,c36,c44,c45,c46,c55,c56,c66)}

 \item Append content of file \lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/parallel_ASKI.f90} 
   to file \lcode{SPECFEM3D/src/shared/parallel.f90}

\item Recompile the relevant \lcode{SPECFEM3D} binaries by issuing \lcode{make xmeshfem3D xspecfem3D} 
  in directory \lcode{SPECFEM3D/}

\item In order to produce \ASKI output in \lcode{SPECFEM3D} simulations, copy file 
    \lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/Par_file_ASKI} to your respective \lcode{DATA/} path
    (which is e.g.\ \lcode{SPECFEM3D/EXAMPLES/my_example/DATA/} , or \lcode{SPECFEM3D/DATA/} ). This 
    file must be adjusted for any specific simulation (just as all other parameter files), 
    refer to the documentation or examples on how to use it.

\end{enumerate}

If you have a newer version of \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} which does not work with \ASKI as thus described, we
are happy to hear about it. Please feel free to get in touch with the \ASKI developers (via
\url{http://www.rub.de/aski}).

\section{General Things to Consider} \label{general_stuff}
%#############################################################
%
\begin{itemize}
\item parameters \lcode{FILE_KERNEL_REFERENCE_MODEL} and \lcode{FILE_WAVEFIELD_POINTS} 
  of the \ASKI parameter file for a specific iteration step must be set to some main \ASKI output file,
  which is the basefile name of \lcode{ASKI_outfile} extendet by \lcode{.main}, see \ref{Par_file_ASKI,sub:output}.
  Use the main \ASKI output file of some arbitrary \ASKI output, e.g.\ the kernel displacement output of the first source
  or some kernel green tensor output.
\item As there is a fixed order assumed of the \ASKI wavefield points (by procs and local element numbering), the 
  computation of many kernels (e.g.\ for many source-receiver paths in an inversion) can only be consistent, if the 
  \emph{same} mesh decomposition and the \emph{same} number of procs is used at all times 
  (for those kernels you want to use together in some analysis, e.g.\ all kernels in your specific iteration 
  step of an inversion).
  It may, hence, be sensible to run the mesher \emph{once} before all simulations are conducted (only re-setting the
  source mechanism and \lcode{Par_file_ASKI} before a specific simulation, adjust your 
  script \lcode{run_mesher_solver.bash} appropriately). Such a mechanism is supported by the automated python script
  through flag \lcode{use_different_command_in_first_simulation}.
\item You must use \lcode{PRINT_SOURCE_TIME_FUNCTION = .true.} in the SPECFEM3D \lcode{Par_file} in order to ensure correct
  functionality (relevant for cases \lcode{ASKI_DECONVOLVE_STF = .true.} in \lcode{Par_file_ASKI}).
\item You must set \lcode{ROTATE_SEISMOGRAMS_RT = .false.} in the SPECFEM3D \lcode{Par_file} in order to ensure that 
  synthetic data (or measured data for synthetic studies) can be transformed to the spectral \ASKI format correctly (by programs
  as in sections~\ref{transform_synthetics}, \ref{transform_measured}).
\end{itemize}
%

\section{One Single Simulation} \label{no_script}
%#############################################################
%
As usual, you need to set the mesh according to the needs of your seismic problem, e.g.\ the
resolved highest frequency etc. You need to choose a \lcode{SPECFEM3D} background model (defined
in \lcode{Par_file} as usual). For details on how to import the current model of an inverision 
(the model of the last iteration step) into \lcode{SPECFEM3D}, see section \ref{import_model}.
Refer to the same section on how to set a different 1D background model or superimpose a 
checkerboard / spike-test model.

Set the regular \lcode{SPECFEM3D} files \lcode{Par_file}, \lcode{CMTSOLUTION} 
and \lcode{STATIONS} (standard \lcode{SPECFEM3D} functionality).

Additionally, you need to set file \lcode{Par_file_ASKI} to desired values. The file is described 
in detail in section~\ref{file_Par_file_ASKI}. 

After that, you are ready to run the code. Since all relevant information for producing \ASKI output 
are read on runtime, you do not need to recompile the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} code every time you
run a \lcode{SPECFEM3D} simulation for \ASKI, you just need to set the above listet parameter files.
%
%-------------------------------
% SECTION using python script
%#############################################################
\section{Using Automated Python Script for Doing Several Simulations} \label{use_script}
%#############################################################
%
As usual, you need to set the mesh according to the needs of your seismic problem, e.g.\ the
resolved highest frequency etc. You need to choose a \lcode{SPECFEM3D} background model (defined
in \lcode{Par_file} as usual). For details on how to import the current model of an inverision 
(the model of the last iteration step) into \lcode{SPECFEM3D}, see section \ref{import_model}.
Refer to the same section on how to set a different 1D background model or superimpose a 
checkerboard / spike-test model.

Python script \lcode{run_specfem3dGlobeForASKI_simulations.py} (provided in directory 
\lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI}) conducts the specified 
kernel simulations (as described inside the script on the top) by running 
\lcode{SPECFEM3D} simulations one after another, setting all parameter files before each simulation appropriately.
You need to edit the parameters in the first part of the script and set all variables defined 
there to appropriate values, as described in the comments in the script 

({\bf TODO IN THE FUTURE:} maybe it is better to have an input (file?) mechanism to this script. But then: more
overhead/extra requirements (packages, arguments handling) to cope with on cluster machines \dots)

The python script may not be suitable for the HPC system you are using. If you are not able to adapt 
it in a way which makes it possible to be used, you might have to figure out an analogous way yourself 
how to perform the tasks done by this script.

In case of using the provided python script \lcode{run_specfem3dGlobeForASKI_simulations.py},
some parameters in \lcode{SPECFEM3D} files \lcode{CMTSOLUTION}, \lcode{Par_file} 
and in file \lcode{Par_file_ASKI} are automatically changed, while the script conducts the
\lcode{SPECFEM3D} simulations one after another.

In the following, only those parameters/lines are listed, which, if necessary, need to be set 
\emph{manually} before running this python script. All other parameters are set by the script.

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Manually Setting \lcodetitle{Par\_file\_ASKI}}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The following \lcode{Par_file_ASKI} parameters need to be set manually before running the python script, 
since they are not changed/set by the script.
\begin{itemize}
\item \lcode{USE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL,FILE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL}
\item \lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL,FILE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL}
\item \lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_INTERPOLATION_TYPE,ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS}
\item \lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_CHECKER_MODEL,FILE_ASKI_CHECKER_MODEL}
\item \lcode{ASKI_MAIN_FILE_ONLY} (must be set to \lcode{.false.}, otherwise no \ASKI wavefield output will be produced!)
\item \lcode{OVERWRITE_ASKI_OUTPUT}
\item \lcode{ASKI_DECONVOLVE_STF} (strongly recommended to set to \lcode{.true.} always)
\item \lcode{ASKI_DFT_double}
\item \lcode{ASKI_DFT_apply_taper,ASKI_DFT_taper_percentage}
\item in case of \lcode{define_ASKI_output_volume_by_inversion_grid = False} in the python script, 
  you need to manually set all parameters concerning the inversion grid, i.e.\ \lcode{ASKI_type_inversion_grid}, 
  \lcode{ASKI_nchunk}, \lcode{ASKI_(c/w)(lat/lon)}, \lcode{ASKI_rot_gamma}, \lcode{ASKI_r(min/max)}
\end{itemize}

%
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Manually Setting \lcodetitle{CMTSOLUTION}}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%
The python script \emph{always} automatically sets ``latitude:'', ``longitude:'', ``depth:'', 
``Mrr:'', ``Mtt:'', ``Mpp:'', ``Mrt:'', ``Mrp:'', ``Mtp:''. In case of ``gt'' \emph{and} ``displ'' simulations,  
``half duration:'' is set to ``0.''
\ASKI follows the idea to also compute ``displ'' wavefields 
with an impulsive source-time function (setting \lcode{ASKI_DECONVOLVE_STF = .true.}) and apply filters
afterwards.
For simulations of type ``data'', however, ``half duration:'' is \emph{not} modified by the python script!
%
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Manually Setting \lcodetitle{STATIONS}}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%
In the upper part of the python script, the flag \lcode{create_specfem_stations} can be set to \lcode{True}.
In this case, the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} \lcode{STATIONS} file is automatically generated from the 
\ASKI file \lcode{FILE_STATION_LIST}.

If you do not use this flag to automatically generate the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} \lcode{STATIONS} file,
you must provide it manually.
The standard \lcode{SPECFEM3D} \lcode{STATIONS} file should contain the definition of stations as
in the \ASKI file \lcode{FILE_STATION_LIST}, in consistend \lcode{SPECFEM3D} notation, i.e.\ coordinate
columns being lat (third column of \lcode{STATIONS} and fourth column of \lcode{FILE_STATION_LIST}) and 
lon (fourth column of \lcode{STATIONS} and third column of \lcode{FILE_STATION_LIST}) and 
elev (sixth column of \lcode{STATIONS} and fifth column of \lcode{FILE_STATION_LIST}). 

You must also assure to use the very same station names and network codes in file \lcode{STATIONS} as in 
\ASKI file \lcode{FILE_STATION_LIST}!

% SECTION importing an external model
%#############################################################
\section{Importing external models into \lcodetitle{SPECFEM3D}, e.g.\ simple background model or currently inverted model for next iteration step} \label{import_model}
%#############################################################
%
There are three types of external models that can be put (in combination) into \lcode{SPECFEM3D}, 
using the additional module \lcode{ASKI_external_model}:

Simple 1D layered spline-interpolation models can overwrite the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} model chosen in
\lcode{Par_file}.
Exported \lcode{.kim} files (as produced by \ASKI program \lcode{exportKim} with option \lcode{-otxt}) may be 
superimposed onto the background model (default \lcode{SPECFEM3D} model or \ASKI 1D background model) 
and used as a model for the new iteration of full waveform inversion of \ASKI. 
After that, a checkerboard / spike-test model can be superimposed onto the resulting model, imposing relative
model perturbations in a checkerboard or spike-like fashion that can be used for resolution analysis.

These three types of external models are explained in the following. The use any of these is controlled by
respective flags in \lcode{Par_file_ASKI}.

%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Overwrite background model by simple 1D layered gradient model} \label{import_model:ssec_1D}
%-------------------------------------
The logical flag \lcode{USE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL} in \lcode{Par_file_ASKI} indicates whether 
\lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} should use the 1D reference model as defined in the text file with name given by 
\lcode{FILE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL} , relative to \lcode{DATA/} .
This mode will overwrite model values on all GLL points, dependent on depth. 
\emph{A model like this will not affect the meshing of spectral elements or any internal boundaries created
by the meshing process!}

The 1D model is defined by a list of model values at given deph nodes between which a spline interpolation 
is done. 
A template of such a background model file, containing documenting commentary, is given by file 
\lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/ASKI_background_model_template}.
The specific format of this text file is described now in the following:

{\bf the first line} is ignored, this line may contain a short description of the model or can be empty.

{\bf the second and third line} simply define the characteristics of the depth nodes which are defined 
in the table (for convenience when reading the file by the program):\\
The second line must contain the number of layers, between which discontinuities are allowed in the 1D model. 
At the boundary of any two layers, there should be a ``double node'', i.e.\ two lines with \emph{same} depth. 
There is no spline interpolation done accross any layer boundaries, i.e.\ over any double node. 
Different model values on either side of a double node will be interpreted as a discontinuity in the model. 
You can also set the same model value on either side of a double node, e.g.\ if you want to have a half space
of the same model values as a gradient coming from above, etc.\\
The third line contains as many integer values (separated by white space) as there are layers 
(as defined by line two) and gives for each layer the number of nodes. 

{\bf starting from line 4}, each line defines a depth node giving (isotropic) model values at this depth.
The columns are separated by white space and assume the meaning:\\
depth [m] \ \ \ \ \ density [g/cm\textsuperscript{3}] \ \ \ \ \ vp [km/s] \ \ \ \ \ vs [km/s] \ \ \ \ \ Qmu \ \ \ \ \ Qkappa\\
The depth is assumed to be monotonically \emph{increasing}, the first line should have depth 0. 

{\bf Everything below} the expected number of lines is ignored, so you can also add commentary below the
model definition.

%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Impose exported \lcodetitle{.kim} model onto background model} \label{import_model:ssec_kim_export}
%-------------------------------------
This functionality is controled by logical flag \lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL} along with
the parameters \lcode{FILE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL, ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_INTERPOLATION_TYPE, 
ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS} in \lcode{Par_file_ASKI}.

\lcode{FILE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL} provides the filename (relative to directory \lcode{DATA/}) of the exported 
\lcode{.kim} file (text file as produced using option \lcode{-otxt} of \ASKI executable \lcode{exportKim}).

\lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_INTERPOLATION_TYPE} and \lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS}
control the method of interpolating the given inverted model (defined on an \ASKI internal inversion grid) 
onto the GLL points used in your \lcode{SPECFEM3D} simulation. At the moment, an unstructured 3D 
interpolation after Shepard \cite{Shepard68} is supported  which is founded on inverse-distance weighting 
and accounts for issues of nearby points, direction and slope. 
\lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_INTERPOLATION_TYPE}
can be either set to \lcode{shepard_standard} or to \lcode{shepard_factor_radius} .

In case of type \lcode{shepard_factor_radius} , the factor given by \lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS}
controls the influence of neighbouring control nodes on the interpolation (larger factor will include more 
control nodes (further away) for the interpolation). For a particular GLL point, first the closest control node of the inverted model
(center of inversion grid cell) is found. Then this distance is multiplied by 
\lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS} to yield a radius within which all contained control nodes
of the inverted model will be taken into account to compute the interpolated value for that GLL point.

Method \lcode{shepard_standard} is the same as using \lcode{shepard_factor_radius} with \lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS = 2.0}.
This factor proved to be a good choice. When setting the method to \lcode{shepard_standard}, any value given for 
\lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS} is ignored.

%-------------------------------------
\subsection{Impose checkerboard/spike-test model onto the resulting model} \label{import_model:ssec_checker}
%-------------------------------------
\emph{A checkerboard/spike-test model as described in this section is only supported for 1-chunk simulations!}

Onto the ``final'' resulting model (i.e.\ the chosen \lcode{SPECFEM3D} model, after possibly overwriting by an 
\ASKI 1D background model (or not), after possibly superimposing a \lcode{.kim} inverted model (or not)), 
relative checkerboard / spike-test anomalies can be superimposed in order to conduct resolution analysis tests.

These anomalies are defined by their width and gaps between them (in km on the surface), in both, lat 
and lon direction of the chunk, i.e.\ the XI and ETA directions, as well as the depth locations and thicknesses
of checker layers. The anomalies are defined by positive percentages which alternate in sign throughout the 
checker grid.
A template of such a model file, containing documenting commentary, is given by file 
\lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/ASKI_checker_model_template}.
The specific format of this text file is described now in the following:

{\bf the first line} is ignored, this line may contain a short description of the model or can be empty.

{\bf the second and third line} define the lateral distribution of checkers and background gaps in between
in lat and long direction of the model chunk. The given sizes [km] at the surface of the Earth are projected 
into depth and distributed equi-angularly on the model chunk.

{\bf the fourth line} gives the number of depth layers in which there should be checker patterns. 
Must be a positive integer.

{\bf the fifth line} defines the depth values [km] of the upper boundaries of the checker layer.

{\bf the sixth line} defines the thicknesses [km] of the checker layers.

{\bf the seventh line} finally contains 5 percentage values separated by white space, defining
the relative model anomaly values [positive percentage] of the 5 isotropic parameters 
density, vp, vs, Qmu, Qkappa. The anomalies will be alternating in sign, i.e.\ varying +anomaly -anomaly, etc.

Everything below the expected content is ignored. Also, from each of the above described lines, only the 
expected content is read (e.g.\ just two numbers are read from lines 2-3) and everything behind is ignored.
This way, you may add arbitrary commentary to a file.

% SECTION Par_file_ASKI

\section{File \lcodetitle{Par\_file\_ASKI}} \label{file_Par_file_ASKI}
%#############################################################
%
File \lcode{Par_file_ASKI} is, just like the file \lcode{Par_file}, located in directory 
\lcode{DATA/} of your current \lcode{SPECFEM3D} example. It basically controls \ASKI functionality 
if used along with an \ASKI extended \lcode{SPECFEM3D} installation. If in such an 
extended \lcode{SPECFEM3D} version the file \lcode{Par_file_ASKI} is not present, no \ASKI output 
is produced and \lcode{SPECFEM3D} runs with standard functionality. 

In the following, we give a short description of the functionality of parameters defined
in file \lcode{Par_file_ASKI}.
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{\lcodetitle{ASKI} external model} \label{Par_file_ASKI,sub:ext_model}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
First the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} model is set, as defined by standard \lcode{SPECFEM} mechanisms (i.e.\ by
flag \lcode{MODEL} in file \lcode{Par_file}). 
Then, \emph{only if indicated} by flag \lcode{USE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL}, this model is overwritten 
by the \ASKI 1D background model at all depths where this background model is defined (see
\myaref{import_model:ssec_1D}).

After that, \emph{only if indicated}, by flag \lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL} an \ASKI inverted 
model is superimposed to the then existing model values (will set absolute model values, 
but at the boundaries of the inversion domain it will smooth out to the existing model, see
\myaref{import_model:ssec_kim_export}).

Yet after that, ONLY IF INDICATED BELOW, one can superimpose a checkerboard by relative model anomalies. By setting 
the respective flags to .false., this checkerboard can be superimposed to any standard SPECFEM model, as well as the ASKI background model
or the ASKI inverted model. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{USE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL, FILE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical flag \lcode{USE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL} indicates whether at all to use a 1D background model and

\lcode{FILE_ASKI_BACKGROUND_MODEL} , defines a filename relative to \lcode{DATA/} from which the 1D model
is read. For the required format of this text file, see \myaref{import_model:ssec_1D}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL, FILE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL, ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_INTERPOLATION_TYPE, 
ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical flag \lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL} indicates whether at all to impose an \ASKI inverted model
onto the existing model (standard background or standard background plus \ASKI 1D background).

\lcode{FILE_ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL} gives the filename relative to \lcode{DATA/} where to find the file containing
the the exported \lcode{.kim} file (text file as produced using option \lcode{-otxt} of \ASKI executable 
\lcode{exportKim}).

Parameters \lcode{ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_INTERPOLATION_TYPE, ASKI_INVERTED_MODEL_FACTOR_SHEPARD_RADIUS} control the
way of interpolating the model values given on control nodes of an \ASKI inversion grid onto the GLL points of
the current \lcode{SPECFEM3D} mesh. For their meaning see \myaref{import_model:ssec_kim_export}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_CHECKER_MODEL, FILE_ASKI_CHECKER_MODEL}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical flag \lcode{IMPOSE_ASKI_CHECKER_MODEL} indicates whether to impose a relative checkerboard / 
spike-test model after defining the model by the chosen \lcode{SPECFEM3D} model, a possible 
\ASKI background model and possible an \ASKI inverted model.

\lcode{FILE_ASKI_CHECKER_MODEL} gives the filename relative to \lcode{DATA/} where to find the file containing
the definition of the checkerboard / spike grid.

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{\lcodetitle{ASKI} output} \label{Par_file_ASKI,sub:output}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{COMPUTE_ASKI_OUTPUT, ASKI_MAIN_FILE_ONLY, OVERWRITE_ASKI_OUTPUT}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter \lcode{COMPUTE_ASKI_OUTPUT} controls whether at all \ASKI output is produced by the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} 
solver (i.e.\ kernel green tensor kernel displacement main or frequency files). 

If \lcode{COMPUTE_ASKI_OUTPUT = .true.}, then logical flag \lcode{ASKI_MAIN_FILE_ONLY} controls whether to
produce only the \lcode{.main} output file at the beginning of a simulation and immendiately terminate. No
frequency output files and no \lcode{SPECFEM} seismograms will be produced in this case. This functionality
is useful, if you want to check the resolution of wavefield points with regard of your chosen inversion grid 
or you want to look at the kernel reference model (background model used by \lcode{SPECFEM}) \emph{before}
running all your simulations for an iteration step of \ASKI waveform inversion. With one single \lcode{.main}
output file available, namely, you can execute the \ASKI executable \lcode{initBasics} and check for everything
related to your wavefield points and inversion grid.

Logical flag \lcode{OVERWRITE_ASKI_OUTPUT} controls if the \ASKI output files files shall be overwritten if 
existend or not. If set to \lcode{.false.} and any of those files exist, the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} solver will 
terminate raising an error message.

Setting \lcode{COMPUTE_ASKI_OUTPUT = .false.} will \emph{not} prevent the \lcode{SPECFEM3D} mesher from
setting an \ASKI background/external/checker (if indicated by above logical flags) ! So you can
use an \ASKI external model along with a standard \lcode{SPECFEM3D} simulation.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{ASKI_outfile, ASKI_output_ID}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\lcode{ASKI_outfile} defines the absolute base file name of \ASKI output files.
The actual output files of this simulation will be this base name appended by file extensions
\lcode{.main} (for main output file) and \lcode{.jf############} for each frequency (e.g.\ \lcode{.jf000013} for 
frequency index 13).

\lcode{ASKI_output_ID} is a character
string of maximum lenght as defined by parameter \lcode{length_ASKI_output_ID} in file\\
\lcode{ASKI_1.0/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/specfem3D_par_ASKI.f90} 
with which all output files of the current simulation will be tagged, and it will be used to check consistency 
of the files (could be a timestamp, eventID, station name + component etc).

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{ASKI_DECONVOLVE_STF}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical flag \lcode{ASKI_DECONVOLVE_STF} indicates whether to deconvolve (the derivative of) the source time 
function from the wavefield spectra before writing them to files. Select \lcode{.true.} for any Green function computations!
Even if a Heaviside source time function is used, the velocity field is not exactly a Green function (i.e.\ displacement 
wavefield w.r.t.\ an impulse source time function), since a steep error function is used by \lcode{SPECFEM} to resemble 
a quasi-Heaviside function. This steep error function, furthermore, is dependent on timestep \lcode{DT}! 
Hence, only by deconvolution of (the derivative of) this quasi-Heaviside source time function, the real Green function 
(generated by an impulsive Dirac source time function), which is independent of the time step can be computed.
\emph{However, for now it is assumed that a quasi-Heaviside is used! Any other actually used source-time-function 
is not accounted for correctly, when} \lcode{ASKI_DECONVOLVE_STF = .true.}.

\subsection{Definition of back propagation Green function}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Since \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE} does not properly support the use of single force sources,
the computation of Green functions requires some additional definitions which
are required by the \ASKI extension code to \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{COMPUTE_ASKI_GREEN_FUNCTION, ASKI_GREEN_FUNCTION_COMPONENT}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical flag \lcode{COMPUTE_ASKI_GREEN_FUNCTION} indicates whether this type of \ASKI output is a Green 
function wavefield (i.e.\ a generalized backpropagation from a receiver) or not. Set to \lcode{.false.} if this 
is a forward wavefield computation from some seismic source.
The source position and source depth of this Green function (i.e.\ techincally the respective \ASKI receiver 
position) must be defined as usual in the CMTSOLUTION file.

By \lcode{ASKI_GREEN_FUNCTION_COMPONENT}, the direction of the single force source of this Green function is 
defined (in case of \lcode{COMPUTE_ASKI_GREEN_FUNCTION = .true.}).
At the moment, the following directions are supported (following the \ASKI nomenclature for receiver components):\\
\lcode{N, E, UP} : pointing to local '\lcode{N}'orth, '\lcode{E}'ast or '\lcode{UP}' direction, dependent on 
source position\\
\lcode{CX, CY, CZ} : global \lcode{C}artesian \lcode{X}, \lcode{Y}, \lcode{Z} directions

\subsection{Frequency discretization}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The double precision \lcode{df} [Hz] and integer values \lcode{jf} have the following meaning:
The spectra are saved for all frequencies \lcode{f = (jf)*df} [Hz].
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{ASKI_df, ASKI_nf, ASKI_jf}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\lcode{ASKI_df} is a predefined frequency step that is used to evaluate the spectrum. In case we want to do 
an inverse FT in case of time-domain sensitivity kernel computation, we need to choose \lcode{ASKI_df} with care 
as \lcode{ASKI_df = 1/length_of_time_series} and suitably high frequency indices (dependent on frequency content).
Otherwise we could lose periodicity (if in \lcode{exp^(-i2pi(k)(n)/N)} \lcode{N} is no integer, these are no 
roots of 1 anymore). The spectra are saved for frequencies \lcode{f = (ASKI_jf)*ASKI_df} (\lcode{ASKI_nf} many).
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{ASKI_DFT_double}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose precision of Discrete Fourier Transform. If there is enough memory available, it is highly recommended
to use \lcode{ASKI_DFT_double = .true.} in which case double complex spectra are hold in memory (single precision is 
written to file, though, but less roundoffs during transformation). Otherwise choose \lcode{ASKI_DFT_double = .false.}
in which case single precision spectra will be used in memory. The transformation coefficients \lcode{exp^(-i*2pi*f*t)} 
are always in double complex precision!
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{ASKI_DFT_apply_taper, ASKI_DFT_taper_percentage}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Decide whether the (oversampled, noisy, ...) time series should be tapered by a hanning taper (on tail)
while applying the discrete fourier transform (on-the-fly). If \lcode{ASKI_DFT_apply_taper = .true.},
the value of \lcode{ASKI_DFT_taper_percentage} (between 0.0 and 1.0) defines the amount of
total time for which the hanning taper will be applied at the tail of the time series.
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Inversion grid}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{ASKI_type_inversion_grid}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
ASKI supports several types of inversion grids for \lcode{FORWARD_METHOD = SPECFEM3D}.
\lcode{ASKI_type_inversion_grid = }
\begin{enumerate}
\item (\lcode{TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = schunkInversionGrid}) \\ 
  \ASKI internal, but \lcode{SPECFEM} independent simple spherical inverison grid
\item (\lcode{TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = scartInversionGrid})\\
  NOT TO BE USED WITH \lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE}!\\
  \ASKI internal, but \lcode{SPECFEM} independent Cartesian inversion grid:\\
  The values for \ASKI output are stored at all inner GLL points of spectral elements which lie
  inside the block volume defined below by parameters \lcode{ASKI_(cw)(xyz)}.
  \ASKI loactes the coordinates of those points inside the inversion grid cells and computes
  integration weights for them.
\item (\lcode{TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = ecartInversionGrid}) \\
  External inversion grid provided e.g.\ by \lcode{Trelis}, which may contain tetrahedra, as well as hexahedra.
  As in case of \lcode{ASKI_type_inversion_grid = 2}, \ASKI output is stored at all inner GLL points of elements
  which are inside the volume defined by \lcode{ASKI_(cw)(xyz)}.
  \ASKI locates the wavefield points inside the inversion grid and computes weights.
\item (\lcode{TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = specfem3dInversionGrid}) \\
  Use \lcode{SPECFEM} elements as inversion grid:\\
  Wavefield points are \emph{all} GLL points of an element for elements which are (at least partly) inside the 
  volume defined by \lcode{ASKI_(cw)(xyz)}. Additionally store the jacobians for all wavefield points.
  Assume \lcode{ncell = ntot_wp/(NGLLX*NGLLY*NGLLY)} as the number of inversion grid cells, and the order of 
  wavefield points accordingly (\lcode{do k=1,NGLLZ;} \lcode{do j=1,NGLLY;} \lcode{do i=1,NGLLX;} \lcode{ip=ip+1 ....})
\item (\lcode{TYPE_INVERSION_GRID = chunksInversionGrid}) \\ 
  \ASKI internal, but \lcode{SPECFEM} independent more elaborate spherical inverison grid supporting several chunks
\end{enumerate}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\lcode{ASKI_nchunk,ASKI_(c/w)(lat/lon), ASKI_r(min/max), ASKI_rot_gamma}}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependent on \lcode{ASKI_type_inversion_grid}, (a selection of) the following parameters may be used to define a volume 
within which wavefield points are searched for:

\lcode{ASKI_nchunk} defines the number of chunks of a chunk cubed sphere. 
\lcode{SPECFEM3D_GLOBE for ASKI} supports 1,2,3 and 6 chunks (like the forward code itself).
However, not all those values are supported by all types of inversion grids: 
the \lcode{schunkInversionGrid} only supports \lcode{ASKI_nchunk = 1},
the \lcode{ecartInversionGrid}, \lcode{specfem3dInversionGrid} and \lcode{chunksInversionGrid} support 
all values 1,2,3,6.

\lcode{ASKI_clat,ASKI_clon} define the center of the first chunks (not used for full sphere with 6 chunks).
\lcode{ASKI_wlat,ASKI_wlon} define the width of the chunk, in case of \lcode{ASKI_nchunk = 1}. 
For \lcode{ASKI_nchunk = 2,3,6}, always \lcode{ASKI_wlon = ASKI_wlat = 90.0} is used.
\lcode{ASKI_rot_gamma} defines the azimuthal rotation angle in degrees by which the 1,2 or 3 chunks are 
rotated (anti-clockwise) about the local vertical axis through the center of the first chunk (not used 
for \lcode{ASKI_nchunk = 6}).
