Everything below the expected content is ignored, hence is this comment block.

The table of values starting from line 4 contains the depth and the (isotropic) model values at that depth. 
The columns are separated by white space and assume the meaning:
depth [km]  density [g/cm^3]  vp [km/s]  vs [km/s]  Qmu  Qkappa
The depth is assumed to be monotonically INCREASING, the first line should have depth 0. 

The second and third line simply define the characteristics of the depth nodes which are defined in the table
(for convenience when reading in the file):
Line two must contain the number of layers, between which discontinuities are allowed. 
At the boundary of any two layers, there should be a "double node", i.e. two lines with SAME depth. There is no spline interpolation
done beyond any layer boundaries, i.e. over any double node. Different model values on either side of a double node
will be interpreted as a discontinuity in the model. 
The third line must contain the number of nodes inside each layer. 


The above example model constitutes the first 200 km of PREM (with the ocean layer removed). 
It has 4 layers. 
The first layer has 2 nodes (at 0.0 and 15.0 km depth) and the model is constant in this layer (same model values at the two nodes).
There is a discontinuity between first and second layer, since the model values are different in the two 15km-lines. 
The second layer has 2 nodes (at 15.0 and 24.0 km depth) and the model is a constant gradient in this layer, since a spline 
between just two points will be a straight line. 
The third layer has 4 nodes (at 24.0, 40.0, 60.0 and 80.0 km depth), there will be a cubic spline fitted through these 4 points. 
Note, that there is no discontinuity in density at 80.0 km depth (i.e. between the third and fourth layer), since the two
80.0km-lines have the very same density value. (By setting always double nodes and choosing the same model values at the double nodes,
this ways you may create a model which is linearly interpolated between the nodes)
The fourth layer has 5 nodes (at 80.0, 115.0, 150.0, 185.0 and 220.0 km depth) ...

The definition of model values of this example model stops at 220km depth. THIS DOES NOT DEFINE ANY MODEL VALUES BELOW 220km DEPTH!
