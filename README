THIS IS A VERY SHORT DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO GET
STARTED WITH

  SPECFEM3D_GLOBE-7.0.0  for  ASKI - versions 1.0 to 1.2

####################################################

SPECFEM3D_GLOBE for ASKI, as well as ASKI and some of its components, 
documentation and examples are available via https://github.com/seismology-RUB
Please find contact addresses there, or visit http://www.rub.de/aski in case 
you want to get in touch with the authors. If you encounter any problems
installing or using the software, it will be helpful to open (or add to) an 
"issues" topic at the respective repository on https://github.com/

The main authors are Florian Schumacher (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany)
and Wolfgang Friederich (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany), 2016.

##########
USAGE, DOCUMENTATION
##########
Read the documentation doc/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_manual.pdf for information on 
how to set parameters correctly and how to use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE as a forward solver 
for ASKI.


##########
REQUIREMENTS
##########
1) You require an installation of the ASKI main package, available via
   https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI :
   git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/seismology-RUB/ASKI
   The directory created by the git clone command will be referred to below as "ASKI/"

2) You need a functioning installation of the SPECFEM3D_GLOBE code, including 
   modifications for usage with ASKI:
-> You can either use the modified slim version of SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_V7.0.0 [2015-07-10]
   that comes with this package in subdirectory specfem3d_globe/
-> OR use your running installation of SPECFEM3D_GLOBE and extend it for usage
   with ASKI (see "EXTEND REGULAR SPECFEM3D" below).
   Also refer to the manual doc/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_manual.pdf, sections 1.3, 1.4

   IN BOTH CASES YOU STILL MUST INSTALL THIS PACKAGE (item "INSTALLATION", below).

3) You need basic experience in using the regular SPECFEM3D_GLOBE software!


##########
INSTALLATION
##########
You should have already cloned the latest version of the master branch of the gitHub 
repository https://github.com/seismology-RUB/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI to THE SAME 
directory where you have cloned the ASKI main package to (in the ASKI documentation 
exemplarily called /your/programs/). That is, make sure that the git clone command
created the directory /your/programs/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI (also referred to 
below simply as SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/) and ASKI was installed to directory
/your/programs/ASKI (also referred to below simply as ASKI/) .

You need to compile few more ASKI binaries:
+ in SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/Makefile , set COMPILER appropriately, 
   adjust FFLAGS if required and set the variables BLAS, LAPACK, just as you did 
   for installing the ASKI main package
+ execute the command
      make all
   from path SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/
After that, ASKI/bin/ should contain the new binaries.


##########
EXTEND REGULAR SPECFEM3D
##########
If you have a regular SPECFEM3D_GLOBE installation which has not significantly
different functionality compared with SPECFEM3D_GLOBE release version 7.0.0 
(2015-07-10), you can extend it for ASKI by the following steps:

1) install SPECFEM3D_GLOBE on your system and make it run, gain 
   experience in using it (below, the installation path is refered to as 
   "specfem3d_globe/")

2) append content of file SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/specfem3D_par_ASKI.f90 to file
   specfem3d_globe/src/specfem3D/specfem3D_par.F90

3) in specfem3d_globe/src/specfem3D/prepare_timerun.F90 in subroutine prepare_timerun :
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the "use ..." statements:
     use specfem_for_ASKI_par
   add the following line close to the end of the subroutine, before synchronize_all() is called:  
     call prepare_timerun_ASKI()

4) in specfem3d_globe/src/specfem3D/iterate_time.F90 in subroutine iterate_time : 
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the "use ..." statements:
     use specfem_for_ASKI_par
   add the following line just before the "enddo" of the main time loop:
      call write_ASKI_output()

5) append content of file SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/ASKI_external_model.f90 to file
   specfem3d_globe/src/meshfem3D/meshfem3D_par.f90

6) in specfem3d_globe/src/meshfem3D/setup_model.f90 in subroutine setup_model : 
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the "use ..." statements:
     use ASKI_external_model
   add the following line just before info output is written to IMAIN, after the 3D models are broadcasted:
     call broadcast_ASKI_external_model(myrank)

7) in specfem3d_globe/src/meshfem3D/get_model.F90 in subroutine get_model : 
   add the following line at the beginning of the subroutine, after the "use ..." statements:
     use ASKI_external_model
   add the following lines just before define elastic parameters in the model (i.e. setting all 
   arrays rhostore,kappavstore,muvstore,...) , just after all other "get model" routines:
        call values_ASKI_external_model(iregion_code,xmesh,ymesh,zmesh,r, &
                              vpv,vph,vsv,vsh,rho,Qmu,Qkappa,eta_aniso,dvp, &
                              c11,c12,c13,c14,c15,c16,c22,c23,c24,c25, &
                              c26,c33,c34,c35,c36,c44,c45,c46,c55,c56,c66)

8) append content of file SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/parallel_ASKI.f90 
   to file specfem3d_globe/src/shared/parallel.f90

9) recompile the relevant SPECFEM3D binaries by issuing "make xmeshfem3D xspecfem3D" in directory specfem3d_globe/

10) in order to use ASKI in SPECFEM3D simulations, copy file 
    SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI/Par_file_ASKI to your respective DATA/ path
    (which is e.g. specfem3d_globe/EXAMPLES/my_example/DATA/ , or specfem3d_globe/DATA/ ). This 
    file must be adjusted for any specific simulation (just as all other parameter files), 
    refer to the documentation on how to use it.


Additionally, you may refer to the manual doc/SPECFEM3D_GLOBE_for_ASKI_manual.pdf
section 1.4 for details on extending a regular SPECFEM3D code copy for use with ASKI.
